 * Simple example code for testing both Turbidity Sensors. 
 * Original code from DFRobot: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Turbidity_sensor_SKU__SEN0189
 * 
 * !!! Must have the turbidity sensors connected on pin A0 and A1 as demonstrated in Arduino Instructions. !!!
 * !!! If you have turbidity sensors connected at different pins, you must replace those in code !!!
